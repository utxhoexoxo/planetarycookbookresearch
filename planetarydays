Planetary days are an ancient & almost universal system of attributing the power of each day of the week to one of the seven traditional planets. this is encoded into our language quite obviously in some cases --as in sun day and mon (or moon) day-- and slightly more veiled in others-- such as wednesday-- but even the briefest etymological research reveals that the root is planetary days 
it appears that the structure of planetary days was initially introduced between the 6th and 8th century in babylonia, a region in which many long-ranging observational astronomical and astrological projects flourished 
this phase of babylonian culture and worship has as one of its features, naming the days for deities that were tightly synchronised with the motions of particular planets. Many cultures have some relationship between divinities or spirits and celestial obbjects, but perhaps none tied planets and divinities so tightly together. for instance, mars was associated with nergal and the sun with shamash. rites to these dieties were timed using planetary methods and techniques; if the diety was linked to mars, then it was dealt with on mars's timescale and pace. 
horoscopic astrology as practiced and defined by the hellenstic texts and later, in the roman empire is an interesting chimeria that has very obvious egyptian and babylonian/mesopotamian elements. planetary days and hours were very much part of the babylonian inheritance. they are one of the pieces of astrology that made it into the mainstream. Eventually the official roman calender adopted the seven day week with the names of the dieties that represented the powers of planets.
