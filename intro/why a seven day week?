the seven day week does not seem to fit cleanly into the other natural time structures that we have. seven is the largest whole number that the visible lunar cycle -counting from one full or new moon to the next- can be divided. the lunar cycle is approximately 29 days, and varies slightly month to month based on the speed at which the moon is travelling. quartering the lunar cycle, as we know the babylonians did, results in four seven-day segments and a leap day. 
although the existence of a leap day might strike people as messy, if you look at the history of calendrics, of trying to turn time into predictable whole numbers, there is always mess. a year for instance, is not exactly 365 days but 365 days and a quarter. we have gone through a number of different solar calendars. the lunar cycle also does not fit exactly in the solar cycle. there are lunisolar calendars with leap months. in the traditional chinese calendar, which uses the jupiter cycle, there are leap years. turning time into repeating sequences of whole numbers is imperfect. 
the seven day week is one of the earliest time structures which is excavated. our very first understanding of time is day and night. our next understanding of time is the lunar cycle, because we can watch it. people get a sense of the year and the seasons but it is harder to count, because the numbers are much larger and the measurements are not quite as obvious. but once we have sun and moon, day and night, we can quarter the lunar cycle. it is out of that quartering of the lunar cycle that the seven day week emerges.
