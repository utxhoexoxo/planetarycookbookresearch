the seven day week does not seem to fit cleanly into the other natural time structures that we have. seven is the largest whole number that the visible lunar cycle -counting from one full or new moon to the next- is divisible. the lunar cycle is approximately 29 days, and varies slightly month to month based on the speed at which the moon is travelling. quartering the lunar cycle, as we know the babylonians did, results in four seven day segments and a leap day. although the existence of a leap day might strike people as messy, if you look at the history of calendrics, of trying to turn time into predictable whole numbers, there is always mess. a year for instance, a year is not exactly 365 days but 365 days and a quarter.
